 <h1> Greetings To The Mothers </h1>
  <p>With our organization's mission to create a safer world for all, we extend our programs to several mothers
      in the  maternity ward at many hospitals. Because mothers are often the first group children expect
      protection from, we empower them with the necessary teachings needed to ensure the safety of their children
      at all the time. Mothers are taught, injected and energized with maltreatment prevention programs,
      so they are able to practise and make it possible for others to follow to provide a home and a community
      free from abuse and maltreatment. On some occasions too, we add to their joy by donating items
      to cater for the needs of their new babies.
