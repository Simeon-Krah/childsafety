 <h1>Who We Are</h1>
 <p> At the Embassy of Children's Safety, we believe that our world would be more beautiful when today's children
     are presented with a healthy and safety environment- a kind that allows them to explore without
     any maltreatment at any stage in their life journey at any place. Realizing the facts regarding
     maltreatment of children and their effects on the life of young people who suffer them, their families and
     the society, our Non-Profit Organization was founded that reaching out to individuals, communities,
     schools, etc. we can educate and empower children and all class of beings likely to be maltreated.
     In our way to make a major contribution to the world, we want to teach maltreatment prevention programs
     so children can grow safe and sound to empower their world, and that is why we ultimately decided to launch
     Embassy of Children's Safety.
