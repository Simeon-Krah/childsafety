<p> "Volunteering is at the very core of being a human.
 No one has made it through life without someone else's help" -<b>Heather French Henry</b>.</p>
<p> There are so many people out there, even around us, that are abused sometimes and the very best we can do
 is to make sure abuses are prevented that people who have once been abused are not abused again or those who
 have never been abused suffer no abuse. To do this, it would likely work faster when collectively,
 we join hands towards this common vision.</p>
 <p> We would be excited to receive your message through the form below with the hope that you would be willing to
  volunteer your time and skills for a safer world for children.</p>
