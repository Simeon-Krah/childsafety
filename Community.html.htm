 <h1> What It Is To Have Us In Your Community </h1>
  <p> At Embassy of Children's Safety, we are dedicated to stepping up our efforts in addressing
      maltreatment and abuse of children. Through this outreach, we visit societies that sadly rank
      high in the country in terms of child maltreatment. Doing that is by no means an easy feat,
      but through cooperation with chiefs and elders of communities, we are able to organise meetings that
      host several people and teach them maltreatment prevention programs and ways to discipline without
      abusing their wards. We are also able to visit people in the communities who have once suffered abuse
      and get them back on their feet through counselling, hospital check-up, mental health screening and
      many others. People are also taught abuse reporting and helped with the necessary contacts to ensure
      people who abuse or maltreat children are brought to book.
