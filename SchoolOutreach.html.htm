 <h1> A Day In Your School </h1>
  <p>According to the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN),
      majority of people likely to be abused or suffer maltreatment are those of the ages between 2 - 17 years.
      Most of these people constitute the student populace in our societies, hence, this initiative where we visit
      primary, junior high and senior high schools. We teach students about the causes and effects of
      maltreatment and the ways to prevent maltreatment or to avoid presenting themselves in a manner that could
      influence someone around to abuse them. In addition, we make known to them their rights and empower them
      through this project, so they are also able to empower others as part of their quota in creating a safer
      world for all children. As part of the activities, the students answer simple questions about things taught
      and stand chances to win prizes and packages from our team.
