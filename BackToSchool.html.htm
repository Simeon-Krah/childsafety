 <h1> Education Belongs To All</h1>
  <p> As part of our activities in ensuring that the world is better for all,
      we make it possible for children who have once left school get back to school
      and continue their education. Homeless children and those hawking on the street as
      a result of maltreatment they suffer in their homes or due to lack of parents also get
      the opportunity to enroll again at schools through the provisions of our generous partners.
      In the near future, the Back to School Project aims at including several refugees children and
      many others from other countries and currently seeking asylum in our country, Ghana.
